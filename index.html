                Hi, I'm Jen, or Cardi, or whatever you want depending on who you are!
                You probably got to this page through a link I put somewhere...wow look at you clicking links!! (or maybe you're an interviewer that i linked this page to while i forgot that, like, i'm supposed to make this viewable for actually real people so i can get a job)<br>

                However you got here, please understand that I'm not <i>entirely</i> this insane all the time!! I do things sometimes, like projects that cater to...things I'm really into at the moment. Or, like, actual stuff that's important!!<br><br>

                Feel free to click around and see what's on here, I guess!!<br>
