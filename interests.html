                So anyways, now that you've clicked on my interests page, I guess I'm legally allowed to just talk about whatever I want now!<br>

                <p class="minorTitle"><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Live!_Nijigasaki_High_School_Idol_Club" title="link to the wikipedia page" style="color: var(--nijiOrange);">Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club</a></p>
            
                <p>So, one thing I really like talking about for some reason is <i>Love Live!</i> and, of my favorite series in <i>Love Live!</i>, <i>Nijigasaki High School Idol Club</i>, especially. To give a brief introduction, Love Live is a series about girls that are idols, but in school, so they're called <i>school idols</i> (wow how original). For 3/5 of the groups in the series, their main goal is to get to and win the in-universe Love Live competition, for school idols, a very lofty goal. Along the way, the series is primarily known for its interpersonal relationships between the girls as they go on their journey to achieve the dreams, a la K-ON's 'cute girls doing cute things'. And, if you couldn't tell, this series is entirely made of girls, rather than boys in high school. (this will be a common theme)</p>

                </center>
                <p>Anyways, Niji girls are different because, unlike the 4/5 other groups in Love Live, they're not <i>trying</i> to get into Love Live. Their general idea is, rather than working as school idols in a <i>group</i>, their thing is that they're working as school idols, separately. General themes for them include: <i>friends but rivals</i> and <i>even though we're working towards different goals, we're all friends and school idols together</i>.</p>
                <p>My favorite character in Nijigasaki and pretty much all of Love Live is Kanata Konoe, the sleep-deprived, hard-working girl that's amazing at cooking and also, for some reason, is everyone's therapist (headcanon).</p>

                <p class="minorTitle"><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D4DJ" title="another d4dj wikipedia link" style="color: var(--d4djPurple);">D4DJ</a></p>
                <p>
                    Another series I absolutely adore is D4DJ, though I've not known it as long as I have Nijigasaki. D4DJ is a multimedia project about DJs, shockingly, specifically, DJ units of 4 people that perform together and their interpersonal and intrapersonal relationships. While that might sound literally insane---because how much content can you get out of being a DJ, <i>really</i>---but D4DJ barely manages to pull it off somehow. The characters are memorable, the rhythm game they have is fun as fuck, and, for some reason, I always keep crawling back to the literal crumbs of yuri they feed us*.<br>
                    *Actually, this is no longer crumbs, D4DJ has a fully-canon, you cannot dispute this AT ALL, lesbian couple. They're in the unit UniCh√òrd, named Hayate Tendo and Kokoa Shinomiya. See below for more details.<br>

                    <p>I'm not even going to <i>try</i> to resize this image. You have to see this thing in its full glory, as I once did several months ago. I could go on and on about how much I love Kokoa and Hayate, the two indisputable lesbians, or how much I adore D4DJ's casually-gender-nonconforming character---Aoi Miyake---or go on about the significance of Muni's doll festival scene, or just how GAY it is that Tsubaki, lead singer of RONDO, is so obviously in love with the DJ---yes it's Aoi---but I won't. Instead, I'll probably end up dropping some screenshots on this page sometime.</p>
