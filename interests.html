                So anyways, now that you've clicked on my interests page, I guess I'm legally allowed to just talk about whatever I want now!<br>
            </p>
            <p class="minorTitle"><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Live!_Nijigasaki_High_School_Idol_Club" title="link to the wikipedia page">Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club</a></p>
            
            <p>So, one thing I really like talking about for some reason is <i>Love Live!</i> and, of my favorite series in <i>Love Live!</i>, <i>Nijigasaki High School Idol Club</i>, especially. To give a brief introduction, Love Live is a series about girls that are idols, but in school, so they're called <i>school idols</i> (wow how original). For 3/5 of the groups in the series, their main goal is to get to and win the in-universe Love Live competition, for school idols, a very lofty goal. Along the way, the series is primarily known for its interpersonal relationships between the girls as they go on their journey to achieve the dreams, a la K-ON's 'cute girls doing cute things'-style.</p>

            <p>Anyways, these girls are different because, unlike the 4/5 other groups in Love Live, they're not <i>trying</i> to get into Love Live.</p>
